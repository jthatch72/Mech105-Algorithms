# Mech105-Algorithms

This directory contains all the algorithm projects that were created for Mech-105 at Colorado State Univeristy. 

The directories contain:
1. **Simpson's Rule** - contains a function to calculate the integral of a data set using Simpson's 1/3 Rule.
2. **Linear Regression** - contains a function that can calcuate the linear regression line of a data set.
3. **LU Decompostion** - contains a function that will calculate the lower, upper, and pivot matrices of a square matrix.
4. **Root Finding** - contains a function that will calculate the root of a function using the false postion method.
5. **Matrix** - contains a function that will create a special matrix.
