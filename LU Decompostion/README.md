# LU Decompostion

The LU Decompostion fucntion uses Gaussian elimation and pivoting to break down a matrix into lower and upper matrices. You input a square matrix, and the algorthim will output the lower matrix (L) which shows all the coeffiecints used. As well as an upper matrix (U), which shows the matrix decomposed.
