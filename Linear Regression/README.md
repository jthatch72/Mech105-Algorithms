# Linear Regression

The linear regression function, takes one set of data points, both the x and y data, and creates a linear regression equation for the data. The function removes any outliers usint the Interqurtile Range method before it calculates the line of best fit and the R squared value. The function will output the X and Y with the outliers removed. As well as the slope and y intercept of the linear regression line, and it will output the R squared value of the line.
