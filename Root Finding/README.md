# False Postion

The false postion function will cacluate the root of a function using the false postion method. The function takes the input of the function you want to find the root of, your intial lower guess, inital upper guess, the desired relative error you want the function to find, and the maximum number of iterations you want the function to go if the realtive error is too low. The function will output the root between the two guesss, what the function is evaluated at the estimated root, the approximate error that was found, and the number of iterations that the function had to use.
