# Simpson's 1/3 Rule

The Simpson's function uses the composite Simpson's 1/3 Rule to evaluate the integral of a data set. The inputs of the function are the independent variables and the recorded values of the data. The function will output the estimated integral of the data. If the data set that is inputed is an odd number, then the function will use the trapozidal rule for one integration of the data.
